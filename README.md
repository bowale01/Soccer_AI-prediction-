## 🧠 Autonomous Prediction Logic

### 🔍 **Quality-First Intelligence Filters:**
1. **H2H Data Sufficiency**: Minimum 3 head-to-head matches between teams
2. **Confidence Threshold**: Only predictions with ≥75% ML confidence
3. **Data Validation**: Automatic rejection of insufficient historical context
4. **API Health Checks**: Real-time validation of data source availability

### 📊 **Autonomous Decision Process:**
```
📡 Fetch Today's Games → 🔍 H2H Analysis → 🤖 ML Processing → 🎯 Quality Filter → 📤 Confident Predictions
```

### 🎯 **Sample Autonomous Output:**
```
🤖 Autonomous AI Analysis Started...
📊 Analyzing 12 football fixtures for H2H data quality...

✅ Arsenal vs Chelsea - 8 valid H2H matches (sufficient)
✅ Liverpool vs Man City - 12 valid H2H matches (sufficient)  
⏭️ NewTeam vs Another - Only 1 H2H matches (insufficient - skipped)
⏭️ Promotion Team vs Top Club - Only 2 H2H matches (insufficient - skipped)

🎯 AUTONOMOUS DECISION: 5 high-confidence predictions generated:
  ✅ 15:00 | Arsenal vs Chelsea: Over 2.5 Goals (87.3% confidence)
  ✅ 17:30 | Liverpool vs Man City: Away Win (81.2% confidence)
  ✅ 20:00 | Barcelona vs Real Madrid: Both Teams Score (79.1% confidence)

🚫 7 matches automatically filtered out (insufficient H2H data)
🎯 Quality-first approach: 5 confident predictions > 20 poor guesses
```
